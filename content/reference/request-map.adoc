== Description

The request map is attached to the link:context-map[Context Map]
before the first interceptor is invoked. The request map describes the
incoming HTTP request, including information about the remote
endpoint.

Pedestal does not attach metadata to the request map.

When processing, take care to modify the map, rather than constructing
a new one. Interceptors may add arbitrary keys to the request map.
